# Student_Management_System


I developed a student management system using Java for the backend, JDBC for database connectivity, and servlets to handle communication between the frontend and backend. The design was implemented using HTML and CSS. This Windows-based application includes full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
